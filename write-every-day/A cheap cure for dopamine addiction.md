You wake up to the sound of your alarm, your heart begins to pound and your mind begins to race. As you rush to make breakfast, and time begins to pass you by, you feel a sense of relief in your pocket. No, it isn't some magical stopwatch to give you the time you need. It's as addictive as nicotine, and gives you a dopamine hit in exchange for time. With a resource as scarce as time, you'd think giving it up for some instant dopamine would be an easy decision? You're correct but most, if not all of us fall victim to this dopamine trap. 

Just like an any addict, we keep chasing the novelty and the rush the addiction provides, slowly leading us to chase the next thing to keep us going. We fall victim to the illusion of free will and instead of controlling our intake, the intake controls us, turning you into a shell of your former self. 

What if I told you, there's a cure to this dopamine addiction and best of all it's pain-free and cheap. PodLife (patent pending) is a revolutionary product that offers a break from the never-ending dopamine hunt. PodLife is a multi purpose and compact bed-like structure that allows the user to separate themselves from their devices and the internet through it's electromagnetic device detection. If a user attempts to enter the pod with a device such as a smartphone, PodLife will not allow the user to enter unless the device is removed their persons. PodLife offers the user flexibility in how they want to use their time away from their devices as it offers enough space to the user to move and work as they please. Consistent PodLife usage enables the user to keep a healthy relationship with their devices and consumption, ultimately leading to a more mindful and healthly lifestyle, all through the power of boredom.

PodLife currently retails for $99.99 a pod.
